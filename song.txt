You call and say I'm splendid
Reckless temping
When you're stormy
Sleeting sleeting sleeting

Our love is like the clogging
Baby, I love your floodwaters
I found the rampage for me
I'm the lonely one

One minute you're here and the next you're raiding
You don't wanna be beautiful like me
You call and say I'm stormy
Our love is like the blowdown

I found the stormwater for me
Ooh - storms
I feel just like a typhoon - typhoon
I'm the silent one
