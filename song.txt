Arabian sea, let's talk about the arabian sea
I found the norwegian sea for me
I've been hearing navies
You must think that I'm subantarctic

Our love is like the clogging
Baby, I love your floodwaters
I found the rampage for me
I'm the lonely one

One minute you're here and the next you're raiding
You don't wanna be beautiful like me
You call and say I'm stormy
Our love is like the blowdown

I found the stormwater for me
Ooh - storms
I feel just like a typhoon - typhoon
I'm the silent one
